# Linear Regression
Linear regression seeks to capture the trends in data by estimating a set of coefficents ($\beta$), that create a line of "best fit" through the data. Linear regression is highly interpretable, which makes it optimal for scientific work; however, it lacks in its ability to model more nuanced relationships.

## Paramater and Statistic Form
Linear regression neatly fits our statistical understanding of infernce. As a result, we will have our estimated coefficents, $\hat{\beta}$, and our poupulation coefficents that encompass the actual relationships, $\beta$.
